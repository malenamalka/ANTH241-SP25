## Course description ##

This course introduces quantitative data analysis used in biocultural
anthropology research. Students will learn statistical methods to engage in research about
health status, diet and nutrition, socioeconomic, and other salient factors that affect
people’s quality of life in the United States and globally.
This semester we will use data from the CDC’s biennial National Health and Nutrition
Examination Survey (NHANES) to develop and test hypotheses about health and diet in the
general U.S. population. Specifically, we will begin the course by defining what is meant by
the term, “biocultural.” Then, we will learn and apply statistical methods to address
questions about the social, demographic, dietary, and environmental factors that
contribute to rising rates of obesity in the U.S. using data from the 2021-2023 NHANES
cycle. In the second half of the semester, students will develop their own biocultural
quantitative research projects with NHANES data. We will learn statistical methods using R
and R Studio software, which are freely available.

After completing this course, students should be able to:
* Understand the concept of biocultural in anthropological scholarship
* Recognize and develop hypotheses in social science research
* Apply statistical methods to test hypotheses in social science research
* Present quantitative research findings in written and graphical formats
* Run statistical methods using R programming and R Studio software
